# Data Context Market (DCM)

**A decentralized marketplace to create, store, and monetize datasets - where AI agents discover and purchase data via x402 payments.**

---

## Overview

DCM bridges data creators and AI agents through a decentralized marketplace. Create datasets from blockchain data or upload your own files, store them permanently on Filecoin, set your price, and let AI agents discover and pay for your data autonomously.

---

## Technology Stack

### 🤖 MCP (Model Context Protocol)

DCM is built as a suite of MCP servers that integrate directly with AI assistants like Claude. Users can index blockchain data, upload files, and manage datasets using natural language commands. AI agents can autonomously discover and purchase data.

### 📊 SQD (Subsquid) Pipes SDK

We built an MCP server around SQD Pipes SDK for natural language blockchain data indexing. Users can create pipes to index any smart contract event, apply custom filters, aggregate data, and export to CSV - all through prompts.

### 🗄️ Filecoin Storage

We built an MCP server for decentralized storage and marketplace functionality. Upload files to Filecoin, set pricing, register datasets on-chain, and enable AI agents to discover and purchase data.

### 💰 x402 Protocol

HTTP-native micropayments enabling AI agents to autonomously pay for data. Agents can discover datasets and purchase them instantly with USDC on Base - no human intervention required.

### 👛 Embedded Wallets

AI agents have their own embedded wallets to make autonomous payments. This enables true agent-to-agent commerce where agents can browse, purchase, and download data without user involvement.

### 🔗 Data Registry (On-Chain)

Smart contract on Sepolia tracking all uploaded datasets:

- Immutable record of every upload
- Discoverable metadata (name, description, price, PieceCID)
- Payment routing to creator wallets

### ⚡ ClickHouse

High-performance analytics database:

- Columnar storage optimized for aggregations
- Fast ingestion of millions of events
- SQL interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker (for ClickHouse)
- Claude Desktop with MCP support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/BA-hack.git
cd BA-hack
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
cd mcp-sqd && npm install
cd ../dcm-mcp-server && npm install
```

3. Configure Claude Desktop MCP:

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sqd-pipes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/BA-hack/mcp-sqd/mcp-server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "ETHERSCAN_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    },
    "filecoin-dcm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/BA-hack/dcm-mcp-server/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "STORACHA_KEY": "your-key",
        "STORACHA_PROOF": "your-proof"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Start ClickHouse (optional, for local analytics):

```bash
docker run -d --name clickhouse -p 8123:8123 clickhouse/clickhouse-server
```

## Usage

### Example 1: Index Uniswap V4 Whale Swaps

**Step 1 - Create & Run Pipe:**

```
Generate and run a pipe for Uniswap V4 PoolManager at
0x000000000004444c5dc75cB358380D2e3dE08A90 on mainnet.
Track Swap events with minimum amount filter of 100000000000000000000
(100 ETH, 18 decimals). From block 21900000 to block 21910000,
table name "v4_swaps".
```

**Step 2 - Aggregate:**

```
Stop the pipe. Then aggregate the CSV file, group by to_address,
sum the amount column as total_volume, count transactions as swap_count,
sort by swap_count desc, limit 20.
```

**Step 3 - Upload to Filecoin:**

```
Upload to Filecoin with name "UniswapWhales", price $0.01,
description "Top Uniswap V4 traders by swap count"
```

### Example 2: Track Aave Deposits

```
Generate and run a pipe for Aave V3 at
0x87870bca3f3fd6335c3f4ce8392d69350b4fa4e2 on mainnet.
Track Supply and Withdraw events with minimum amount filter of
100000000000000000000000 (100k tokens). From block 16291127,
table name "aave_whales".
```

### Example 3: Discover & Purchase Data

```
Search for "uniswap" datasets
```

```
Download dataset with PieceCID bafkzcibd5qp...
```
